# Audio-Steganography-using-MATLAB
This project is used for encrypting confidential audio files . 
It hides an audio inside an image using quantization and LSB Steganography techniques in MATLAB.
The code encrypts an audio at the sender side, and decrypts it at the receiver side. Both the functions are written in a single code.
